Title:
<Addressing Voter Turnout Disparities
through Data-Driven Resource Allocation>

Abstract:
<Voter turnout disparities persist across racial and socioeconomic groups, lim-
iting fair democratic participation. Despite efforts to increase overall voter
engagement, inequities in resource allocation continue to disproportionately
affect underserved communities. This project addresses the challenge by
leveraging Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and Mixed Integer Programming
(MIP) to optimize polling station placement in Georgia, with the dual objec-
tives of maximizing overall turnout and reducing racial disparities. By iden-
tifying key causal relationships and integrating fairness constraints, our ap-
proach ensures that additional resources are allocated to communities with
the greatest need. Using publicly available election data and census demo-
graphics, we develop an intervention strategy that quantifies the impact of
polling station adjustments on turnout rates.>
